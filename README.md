# Libgdx-First-Game
I am sharing my first try libgdx game project. 

##Â Description of game :
Random created shurikens follow the main character. Physics engine not included in this project.

Here is first project that includes following topics:

0. Touchpad
0. Actions
0. Stage
0. OrthographicCamera
0. Viewport

Character top movement sprites are bad btw :)
